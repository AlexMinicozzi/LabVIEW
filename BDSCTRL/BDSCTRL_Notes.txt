Controls to add to Panel Functions:
TX digital gain per channel, RFIC BCU State?

IF Calibration needs to measure "SemiAutoCal" and then run a function that loads IF coefficients into RFIC.  Consider individual
looping technique to allow detailed observation of each device measurement for both IF and RF calibrations.

Do global variables auto update calling VI indicators?


Make Packet:

Make Header (Hex)
Make Body (Hex)
Make Tail (Hex)

Make Packet 

little endian gets applied only to EACH FIELD



Checksum performed on the byte stream level


Matlab Vienna Structure:

-Panel Function Call
	-IssuePanelCommand(MainCommand,SubCommand,Inputs)
		-Header = MakeHeaderTemplate(Source,Target,MainCommand,SubCommand, 'Request Packet', DataReturnRequest)
		-Body = MakePanelCommandBody(MainCommand,SubCommand, Inputs)
			-PanelFunction Specific Make Body call
		-Tail = MakeTail()
		-Packet = MakePacket(Header,Body,Tail)
			-Create Checksum Bytes
			
			
-Melvitron SemiAutoCal
	-Set VGA for Tx and Rx
	-Reset Channels
	-Set Probe to default position
	-Calibrate along each Co-Pol line
		-Probe directions along short and long axes
		-Set VNA for Tx or Rx measurement
		-Set Channel Enable for device for measure
		-If Tx Measure, set PAL off
		-Set BCU State to 'MAG'.  What is this?
		-Measure Amplitude with VNA w/ averages:VNA_Meas_Channel_Single.  Measure Count number and verify diff is stable.
		-Turn on PAL correction
		-Turn off PAL correction
		-Calibrate Phase:
		-Set BCU State to 'Phase'
		-Measure phase value in count loop and check for stability: MELV_Calibrate_Phase
		-Turn back on PAL Correction
		-Disable Channels
	-Repeat calibration along each Cx-Pol line
